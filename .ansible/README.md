## ⚡ Run automation

```
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_path> -e <extra_vars> <playbook_path>
```
> 📚 **Useful links**
> - [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html)

### Example
```
ansible-playbook -i /var/www/wp-starter/.ansible/inventory/hosts.yml -e "ansible_user=ec2-user mysql_user=wordpress" /var/www/wp-starter/.ansible/tasks/stage.playbook.yml
```

> 🔔 You would usually run this command in a CI/CD pipeline, before copying your code to wanted environment. Github Actions 
> and Azure Pipelines already have Ansible installed on their agents and no pre-installment is needed.

- Ansible host(s)
  - machines on which playbook tasks are run

  - installed on the Ansible control node

## 📘 About

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open source tool used to automate tasks, at least in our case. In this starter project, we use it to prepare 
or local, stage, production or any other environment so that we can deploy our code to expected and tested environments. Also, 
if we migrate or want to deploy the code to other environments, we can easily do so.

## 🧑‍💼 Ansible in use

A simple use-case is explained here:
- project is ready for deployment (to any environment)
- edit `hosts.yml` inventory file and add your host information
  - > ⚠ Don't write sensitive host information like credentials here, only general ones
- edit `default.yml` variables with general project information
- create or edit `.yml` file for your host with variables for that host
  - > ⚠ Don't write sensitive information like credentials here, only general ones
- create or edit `.yml` playbook with needed tasks
- run `ansible-playbook` [command](#-run-automation)
  - > ⚠ Your should provide the sensitive variables here with _-e_ flag
